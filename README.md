# Analysis
 ### **Skill Diversity**:
- There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Geographic Information Systems Analyst to VP of Data Science & Research, reflecting varied roles and specializations within the field of Data Science.
### **Skill Insights Summary**:
- Python, SQL, and R are foundational skills for data scientists, required across the board.
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) and big data tools (Spark, Hadoop) are vital for scaling data processing workflows.
- Machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) show strong demand for AI/ML capabilities.
- Niche tools like SAS, MATLAB, and Haskell highlight specialized needs, especially in research-intensive fields.

### **Key Observations on In-Demand Skills**:


- **Python and SQL are universally critical**: Both in India and globally, Python and SQL are the top two skills. Their dominance highlights that programming and database querying are essential for any data science role, regardless of region.
- **R is more important globally**: The normalized demand for R is higher globally than in India, indicating that R is more critical on the global stage. This could be due to the prevalence of industries such as academia, healthcare, and finance, where R is widely used.
- **SAS is more prominent globally**: SAS ranks fourth globally, but it doesn't even appear in India's top 10. This suggests that SAS has become more regionally specialized and less relevant in India's job market.
- **Cloud and Big Data Skills (AWS and Spark)**: AWS and Spark are in demand both globally and in India, though their normalized demand is quite similar across regions. This reflects the growing importance of cloud computing and big data technologies for data scientists worldwide.
- **India prioritizes TensorFlow more than the world**: TensorFlow appears more prominently in India's top skills than globally. This suggests that deep learning technologies, especially TensorFlow, are gaining ground in the Indian market, perhaps due to the rise of AI and machine learning startups.
- **Excel vs. Tableau**: Tableau is present in both markets but has slightly higher demand globally than in India.Interestingly, Excel has no significant demand globally in this dataset, possibly indicating that companies are transitioning to more advanced tools for data analysis and reporting.
- **PyTorch and Hadoop in India**: PyTorch is a deep learning tool that makes the top 10 list in India, indicating that it is an emerging skill in the Indian market, even though its demand is still low.Hadoop, once a dominant big data technology, is now virtually obsolete in India's data science job market, with Spark taking the lead.
